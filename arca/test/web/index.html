        <h1>Arca musarithmica Athanasii Kircherii MDCL</h1>
        <p>
        A digital implementation of Athanasius Kircher´s device for automatic
        music composition from his <cite>Musurgia universalis</cite> (Rome,
        1650), Book VIII.
        </p>
        <p>
        Implemented in Haskell by Andrew Cashner (Rochester, New York,
        2021).

          <h1>An <q>Ark</q> of Musical Knowledge in Infinite Permutations</h1>

          <p>The <em>Arca musarithmica</em> is a set of data tables, which
          together with a list of rules for how to use the tables, amounts to a
          computation device for composing music. Given input in the form of a
          marked text in Latin and a small set of simple choices about the musical
          setting, a user who knows nothing about music can use the ark to
          generate completely unique, never-before-heard musical settings of that
          text for four-voice (SATB) chorus.</p>
          <p>Kircher presented this as an embodiment of mathematical permutations.
          Like many of his seventeenth-century contemporaries, he understood music
          as <q>sounding number</q>, an embodiment of the mathematical order
          inherent in God's created universe, and a reflection of the perfection
          of God himself. Out of the infinite variety of possible combinations of
          notes and rhythms, the user of the ark selects a specific set of
          permutations and thus imitates God in his original act of creation.
          </p>

          <p>The combination of structured data and completely prescribed
          algorithms makes Kircher's device a kind of <strong>music computer</strong>.
          This implementation, written in the pure-functional programming language
          Haskell, demonstrates that the entire ark can be modeled in terms of
          mathematical functions using lambda calculus. 
          It takes one series of symbols, representing an input text and the
          choice of musical parameters, and transforms those into another set of
          symbols that represents musical notation.</p>
          <p>Kircher intended his device for the total musical novice, a
          <q>Tyro</q> who knew <em>nothing</em> about music except the rules he
          provided. Kircher did not know it, but he was describing an automatic
          computer. All we have done is create a digital version of his ark that
          an electronic computer, the ultimate know-nothing, can use to generate
          music.</p>
          <p>Run the ark as many times as you like and create ever-new, unique
          musical combinations!</p>
