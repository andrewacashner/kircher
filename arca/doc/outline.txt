for each section:
- store the meter and mood settings
- get the arca:lyrics element (assume 1 for now)
- parse the lyrics: break into sentences, then words, then syllables;
- group the sentences in groups of words according to syllable counts;
+ store data about accent/length in the syllables(long/short), words(position),
    and phrases (penultimate value; later, poetic meter)

    for each word group:
    - select syntagma based on arca:arca:music/@style
    - select pinax based on penult length
    - select column based on syl count
    - select vperm randomly 
    - select rperm type based on meter
    - select rperm randomly
    - align notes and rhythms/rests; store in chorus/voice/note structures
    - adjust notes for mode offset based on section/@mood and allowable modes for
    this pinax

    for the whole section now with notes:
    - within voice: adjust intervals to avoid bad leaps
    - adjust octaves and intervals based on voice ranges (music/@clefs) for each
    voice and distance between voices
    - add ficta accidentals to voices according to mode and context
    - fix tritones, cross-relations between voices

    - go to next section

    - after all is done, output to arca:xml (modified MEI)
    - use external xsl tools to convert arca:xml to mei
