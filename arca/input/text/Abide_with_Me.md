| A-bide with me: fast falls the e-ven-tide;
| the dark-ness deep-ens; Lord, with me a-bide.
| When other help-ers fail and com-forts flee,
| Help of the help-less, O a-bide with me.
| 
| Swift to its close ebbs out life's lit-tle day;
| earth's joys grow dim, its glor-ies pass away.
| Change and de-cay in all a-round I see.
| O thou who chang-est not, a-bide with me.
| 
| I need thy pres-ence ev-ery pass-ing hour.
| What but thy grace can foil the temp-ter's power?
| Who like thy-self my guide and strength can be?
| Through cloud and sun-shine, O a-bide with me.
| 
| I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless,
| ills have no weight, and tears no bit-ter-ness.
| Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy vic-tor-y?
| I tri-umph still, if thou a-bide with me.
| 
| Hold thou thy cross be-fore my clos-ing eyes.
| Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
| Heaven's morn-ing breaks and earth's vain sha-dows flee;
| in life, in death, O Lord, a-bide with me.
