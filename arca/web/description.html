      <h1>Arca musarithmica Athanasii Kircherii MDCL</h1>
      <p>
      A digital implementation of Athanasius Kircher´s device for automatic
      music composition from his <cite>Musurgia universalis</cite> (Rome,
      1650), Book VIII.
      </p>
      <p>
      Implemented in Haskell by Andrew Cashner (Rochester, New York,

        <h1>How to compose music using the ark</h1>

        <ol>
          <li>Kircher expects you to <strong>prepare a text</strong> in Latin or
            another language, with words divided into syllables, marked long or
            short. You can set texts in several Classical meters (like
            Anacreontic or Sapphic), but you can also set irregular verse and
            prose texts.
            <ul>
              <li>In this web app, we provide a set of <strong>pre-marked
                  texts</strong>.</li>
              <li>If you download and install the 
                <a href="https://www.bibtucket.org/andrewacashner/kircher.git">command-line
                  version,</a> 
                you can create your own texts that might even have multiple sections
                in different styles and moods!</li>
            </ul>
          </li> 
          <li>Next, Kircher wants you to choose several aspects of the music
            setting you want the ark to create:
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>style</strong> and texture of the music:
                <ol>
                  <li>you can opt for simple, note-against-note counterpoint (like a
                    hymn),</li>
                  <li>or florid, melismatic counterpoint (like a motet, anthem, or
                    even fugue).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>mood</strong> or character of the text and its
                setting, which determines the choice of one of twelve musical
                modes (<em>tonoi</em>).  
                <p>
                Kircher's <em>modes</em> are more like <q>church keys</q> and
                don't line up exactly with the older modes most musicians
                learned.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>The <strong>musical meter</strong> (technically, mensuration)
                of the setting. 
                <ol>
                  <li>In the simple style, you can choose 
                    <ol>
                      <li>duple meter (C),</li>
                      <li>triple minor (C3, three minims/half notes per metrical
                        unit),</li>
                      <li>or triple major (cut C3, three semibreves/whole notes
                        per metrical unit).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                    Some duple-meter permutations in the ark have a minim pulse
                    (C) and others have a semibreve pulse (cut C).
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>In florid style, everything is in duple meter (C).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If you are operating the ark by hand, you use these input
            parameters to select the proper tables. 
            <ul> 
              <li><strong>Syntagma:</strong> There are three <em>syntagmata</em>
                or large divisions in the ark. For simple style, you select from
                Syntagma I; for florid, use Syntagma II.
                <p>
                Kircher provides a third syntagma as well, but because it would
                be much more difficult if not impossible to make completely
                automatic, we have omitted it from this implementation.
                (An exercise for the reader!)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Pinax:</strong> Each syntagma containes a set of
                <q>rods</q> or <em>pinakes</em> (singular, <em>pinax</em>). You
                select the <em>pinax</em> based on the meter of the text.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Column:</strong> Each pinax contain
                several columns of data. The column is either a free choice, or
                is based on the order of lines in the poem.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Voice and rhythm permutations:</strong> Each column
                includes two parts: sets of numbers representing musical pitches
                (we call these <q>voice permutations</q> or vperms), and sets of
                musical notes representing rhythmic durations (<q>rhythm
                  permutations</q> or rperms).
                <ul>
                  <li>In syntagma I (simple counterpoint), the user is supposed
                    to freely choose one set of vperms and one set of
                    rperms. All the musical voices use the same rhythms.
                    <ul>
                      <li>In syntagma I, there are (generally) three sets of
                        rhythm permutation, one for each type of musical meter
                        you can use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>In syntagma II (florid counterpoint), there is a set of
                      rperms that matches up with each vperm, so that there is a
                      specified rhythm for each of the SATB voices. This makes
                      independent contrapuntal voices possible.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                  </li>
            </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Writing the  music down:</strong> Next you lay out what
                Kircher calls the <em>palimpsest phontacticum</em>, or what the rest
                of us call <q>music paper</q>.
                You draw out four staves and put an appropriate combination of clefs
                for the four voices. These determine the octave and range of the
                musical output for each voice. You also add a flat in the key
                signature if your mode is in <em>cantus mollis</em> according to the
                table, and add the appropriate mensuration sign.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Matching pitches, rhythms, and syllables:</strong> For
                each phrase of text, you take the pitch numbers and look them up in
                the table for the given mode in order to get note names. You pair
                these note names with the rhythmic values, or just put rests when
                those are given. You write these values on the staff,
                making certain adjustments as needed.
              </li>
              <li>Kircher describes a variety of <strong>adjustments</strong>, some
                of which are easier to automate (that is, are more completely
                prescribed) than
                others: 
                <ol>
                  <li>If the notes go out of range for that voice (too far above or
                    below the staff), you may shift them up or down by octave as
                    needed.</li>
                  <li>The mode tables specify that you may add sharps or flats on
                    certain notes according to <em>musica ficta</em> rules.</li>
                  <li>You may also do more complicated things like swapping the
                    notes for adjacent voices, which require your own judgment.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Digital Implementation</h1>
        <p>In this software we implement only those parts of the ark which are
        completely specified as automatic algorithms.</p>
        <p>Instead of the user's choice of vperms and rperms we choose to tempt
        fate (from a seventeenth-century Catholic perspective and roll the dice,
        a literally aleatoric method, by using computer-generated pseudo-random
        numbers.  Other elements that depend on the user's taste and judgment,
        or elements under-specified by Kircher (like text underlay in
        the melismatic Syntagma II) we leave up to our own users' discretion.</p>
        <p>We encode the data of the ark itself (syntagmata, pinakes, etc.) in a
        set of tables in Haskell, technically nested vectors and lists.</p>
        <p>We read the input text and parameters from an XML file and parse the
        text into sections, sentences/stanzas, and phrases/lines.</p>
        <p>We generate a list of random numbers to use for each phrase, then we
        use these to select the correct vperms and rperms, and adjust these for
        mode and range according to the rules. We then convert our internal data
        types into MEI-XML output.</p>
        <p>In the web app, we use the third-party Verovio app to render the
        musical data to notation.</p>
