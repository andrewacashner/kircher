# Web app TODO

- Use web interface to select either pre-configured text (current input
  texts), or to select an unconfigured text and select mode, meter, etc.
    - Simplest way for latter option is to have all one section
    - Would need to write variables into the XML file (via XSLT?)
- v/ Output MEI instead of PDF and display using Verovio
- v/ Output MIDI also (done by Verovio)
- How to run arca not as system command? (e.g., as CGI file?)

- set MIDI bpm in MEI
    - can be done when producing MIDI via Verovio with --midi-tempo-adjustment 2.0
- set MIDI instruments correctly in MEI
    - right now Verovio MIDI output uses default piano sound (with xdg-open)
