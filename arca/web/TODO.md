# Web app TODO

- Use web interface to select either pre-configured text (current input
  texts), or to select an unconfigured text and select mode, meter, etc.
    - Simplest way for latter option is to have all one section
    - Would need to write variables into the XML file (via XSLT?)
- Output MEI instead of PDF and display using Verovio
- Output MIDI also
- How to run arca not as system command? (e.g., as CGI file?)
